	<h2>The Takeaway</h2>
	<p class="text-lg text-indigo-800">
		The data reveals three critical insights: First, pre-op albumin levels—easily measured and often
		correctable—strongly predict ICU stays. Second, emergency status and ASA score interact in ways
		that standard checklists miss. And third, while we can't change age, we can optimize timing,
		prepare blood products, and adjust recovery expectations based on these risk factors. The data
		tells us where to look—before the knife ever touches skin.
